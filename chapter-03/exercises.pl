%% Chapter 3 - Exercises

%% Exercise 3.1
%% Do you know these wooden Russian dolls, where smaller ones are contained in
%% bigger ones? Here is schematic picture of such dolls.
%% from outer to inner doll: katarina -> olga -> natsha -> irina.
%% First, write a knowledge base using the predicate directlyIn/2 which encodes
%% which doll is directly contained in which other doll. Then, define a
%% (recursive) predicate in/2, that tells us which doll is (directly or
%% indirectly) contained in which other doll. E.g. the query
%% in(katarina,natasha) should evaluate to true, while in(olga, katarina) should
%% fail.

directlyIn(katarina, olga).
directlyIn(olga, natasha).
directlyIn(natasha, irina).

in(X,Y) :- directlyIn(X,Y).
in(X,Y) :-
  directlyIn(X,Z),
  in(Z,Y).

%% Exercise 3.2
%% Define a predicate greater_than/2 that takes two numerals in the notation
%% that we introduced in this lecture (i.e. 0, succ(0), succ(succ(0)) ...) as
%% arguments and decides whether the first one is greater than the second
%% one. E.g:
%% ?- greater_than(succ(succ(succ(0))),succ(0)). -> true
%% ?- greater_than(succ(succ(0)),succ(succ(succ(0)))). -> no

greater_than(succ(_),0).
greater_than(succ(X),succ(Y)) :-
  greater_than(X,Y).
  
%% alternative: 
greater_than(succ(X), X).
greater_than(succ(Y), X) :-
    greater_than(Y, X).

%% Exercise 3.3
%% Binary trees are trees where all internal nodes have exactly two childres. The
%% smallest binary trees consist of only one leaf node. We will represent leaf
%% nodes as leaf(Label). For instance, leaf(3) and leaf(7) are leaf nodes, and
%% therefore small binary trees. Given two binary trees B1 and B2 we can combine
%% them into one binary tree using the predicate tree: tree(B1,B2). So, from the
%% leaves leaf(1) and leaf(2) we can build the binary tree tree(leaf(1),
%% leaf(2)). And from the binary trees tree(leaf(1), leaf(2)) and leaf(4) we can
%% build the binary tree tree(tree(leaf(1), leaf(2)), leaf(4)).

%% Now, define a predicate swap/2, which produces a mirror image of the binary
%% tree that is its first argument. For example:
%% ?- swap(tree(tree(leaf(1), leaf(2)), leaf(4)),T).
%% T = tree(leaf(4), tree(leaf(2), leaf(1))).
%% true

swap(leaf(X), leaf(X)).

swap(tree(X, Y), tree(SwappedY, SwappedX)) :-
    swap(X, SwappedX),
    swap(Y, SwappedY).

%% Exercise 3.4
%% In the lecture, we saw the predicate
%% descend(X,Y) :- child(X,Y).
%% descend(X,Y) :- child(X,Z),
%%                 descend(Z,Y).
%% Could we have formulated this predicate as follows?
%% descend(X,Y) :- child(X,Y).
%% descend(X,Y) :- descend(X,Z),
%%                 descend(Z,Y).

%% Compare the declarative and the procedural meaning of this predicate
%% definition.
%% Hint: What happens when you ask the query descend(rose,martha)?

%% Declarative: true if Y is a direct child of X. True if there exists a Z which
%% Y descends and Z descends X.

%% Procedural: If Y is not a child of X, see if any of X's descendants have Y as
%% a descendant.

%% In all false cases it will loop forever (Out of local stack).
%% E.g. when calling descend(rose, martha). it will keep doing the following:

%% Call: descend(rose, _G408) ?
%% Call: child(rose, _G408) ?
%% Fail: child(rose, _G408) ?
%% Redo: descend(rose, _G408) ?

%% Exercise 3.5
%% We have the following knowledge base:

directTrain(nancy,metz).
directTrain(metz,fahlquemont).
directTrain(fahlquemont,stAvold).
directTrain(stAvold,forbach).
directTrain(forbach,saarbruecken).
directTrain(saarbruecken,dudweiler).
directTrain(freyming,forbach).

%% That is, this knowledge base holds facts about towns it is possible to travel
%% between by taking a direct train. But of course, we can travel further by
%% `chaining together' direct train journeys. Write a recursive predicate
%% travelBetween/2 that tells us when we can travel by train between two
%% towns. For example, when given the query
%% travelBetween(nancy,saarbruecken).
%% it should reply `yes'.

travelBetween(X,Y) :- directTrain(X,Y).
travelBetween(X,Y) :-
  directTrain(X,Z),
  travelBetween(Z,Y).

%% It is, furthermore, plausible to assume that whenever it is possible to take
%% a direct train from A to B, it is also possible to take a direct train from B
%% to A. Can you encode this in Prolog? You program should e.g. answer `yes' to
%% the following query:
%% travelBetween(saarbruecken,nancy).
%% Do you see any problems you program may run into?

travelBetween(X,Y) :- directTrain(X,Y).
travelBetween(X,Y) :- directTrain(Y,X).
travelBetween(X,Y) :-
  directTrain(X,Z),
  travelBetween(Z,Y).
travelBetween(X,Y) :-
  directTrain(Z,X),
  travelBetween(Z, Y).

%% alternative: 
directTrain(X,Y) :- directTrain(Y,X).
travelBetween(X,Y) :- directTrain(X,Y).
travelBetween(X,Y) :-
  directTrain(X,Z),
  travelBetween(Z,Y).

%% You will end up in infinite loops since you can go both directions, so it is
%% possible to keep calling the same function over and over.
